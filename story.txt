Once upon a time...
Not long ago...
I was a....
A Year Up student who knew nothing about Software Development.
Now that I have graduated, I am working in the field that I love.
I have become the professional that I have always wanted to be.
Thanks Year Up!
I'm now telling all my friends about this program!
